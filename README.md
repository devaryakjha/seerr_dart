# seerr_dart

Auto-generated Dart/Dio bindings for the [Jellyseerr](https://github.com/seerr-team/seerr) API.

Authentication can be performed either with cookies (via `/auth/plex` or `/auth/local`) or by providing an `X-Api-Key` header generated by Jellyseerr.

This client was produced with [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech):

- API version: 1.0.0
- Generator version: 7.16.0
- Generator: `dart-dio`

## Requirements

- Dart SDK 3.0.0 or later
- [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) 5.7.0 or later

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:seerr_dart/seerr_dart.dart';

void main() async {
  final client = SeerrDart(basePathOverride: 'https://your-jellyseerr-instance/api/v1');
  client.setApiKey('apiKey', 'your-api-key');

  final response = await client.getPublicApi().statusGet();
  print(response.data?.version);
}
```

See the generated documentation in `doc/` for full endpoint coverage.

## Regenerating the client

```bash
make generate
```

This downloads the latest OpenAPI spec, refreshes the generated sources, runs `dart pub get`, regenerates serializers with `dart run build_runner build`, applies `dart fix`, and formats the package.
